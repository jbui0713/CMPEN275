# CMPEN275
LABS
Labs done over the Fall 2019 semester at Penn State Abington for Computer Engineering 275 (CMPEN 275).
CMPEN 275m provides laboratory design exercises to support CMPEN 271 lecture. 
Became familiarized with digital IC circuit design, construction, instrumentation, and debugging.  
The laboratory consists of assignments that gave the opportunity to get hands-on experience of what was learned in the CMPEN 271.
The labs will make use of state-of-the-art DE1-SoC FPGA board.
